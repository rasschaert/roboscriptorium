# Handover

The state of play for the next session: what runs, what comes next, what waits on the
user. Nothing else lives here (AGENTS.md says which file owns what). Rewrite it at the
end of every session. Written 2026-10-17 ~00:45, at the end of the session of 2026-10-16.

## Nothing running.

**Ollama is on 0.40.3; keep it there** with the app's automatic updates off: 0.40.4
refuses winnow (AGENTS.md, Environment).

**Baselines now:** the latest `work/bench/tuning-*` and `validation-*` runs (0.27 and
0.49 after review). After 23:00: the judges' cache key holds the crop (nothing cold),
readers' quotes are curled by the book's style and closed at a line's end (Metro 0.42 →
0.33 wrong words a page), and paragraph starts from the text were tried and reverted
(decisions.md). Tonight's module splits (readers, ocrdoubts, hyphens, scanstyle,
sorterdata, ink, the cache helper) changed no score; the whole-body statistics were
reverted (decisions.md).

## Ex-minnaar: reviewed (2026-10-16)

The user answered every question (206 answers; misprints in `work/ex-minnaar/errata.toml`).
Built with them, epubcheck clean (`work/ex-minnaar/epubs/`). The arbiter was then retrained
with its answers and Stella's (benches no change), and asks 6 more, each a real error the
earlier build left silently: the user may answer them (restart the review server).

The day's review fixes are in decisions.md (2026-10-16): the book teaches itself (its
answers in the arbiter's table and by reader), answered questions stay listed, titles
asked whole, specks unasked, questions shown as their difference with combinations.

## Next, in order

1. Ex-minnaar's 6 new questions by the user (rebuild first: the role trees were
   retrained since), then its read-through.
2. Checklist: the next open step (docs/checklist.md).
3. Stella's read-through by the user (checklist).

**Remind the user of the daily backup of `work/`** at session start and before long
runs: it now also holds `work/ex-minnaar/errata.toml`.

## Waiting on the user

- **Vuurspel into tuning?** It is the only bench book that sets no paragraph indent; a
  learned fix for its missed breaks (`work/probes/parastarts.patch`) has nothing to
  learn from while it validates. Moving it changes what validation checks.
- **A Qwen reading for questions without readings** (headings, missing lines): Qwen reads
  only checked body lines, so there is nothing cached to check a typed answer against;
  reading those lines at review build would offer a reading to click (checklist).

- Remove the Ollama models nothing uses: `gemma4:latest`, `deepseek-ocr:3b`,
  `numind/nuextract3:q6_k`, `imajev:4b`, `hf.co/mindchain/imajev-4b-GGUF:Q8_0`,
  `ornith-1.5:9b`, `ornith-1.5:35b`, `qwen3.8:27b-mxfp8` (not in the way, the user said).
- More golden pairs when convenient.
- **French**: undecided (checklist, Later).

## What this session taught (the rules are in AGENTS.md)

- **A reviewer's answers must teach the book at once.** Ex-minnaar asked "we → wc" 13
  times and stress accents a dozen; the per-book table and reader buckets now learn them.
- **Check a probe's matching before reporting its count**: "7 quote questions settled"
  were questions a probe failed to match to their paragraph.
- **Compare against the day's start, not only the last run**: two changes each within
  noise moved validation the same way (0.48 → 0.50); only the four-way probe showed
  which lines they lost.
- **Test the click, not only the key**: the misprint button crashed with no reading
  chosen (`null >= 0` is true in JavaScript); the key test had chosen one first.

## How to run things

- Long runs through `experiments/timed.sh` inside `experiments/detached.sh` (a screen).
  Warm benches take 2–5 minutes.
- Don't edit `src/` while a bench or build runs; park a change as a patch.
- Nothing reads the test set (Het geluid van bananen) until its single scoring.
- Stopping a run: `experiments/stop-run.sh <name>`; `ollama stop <model>` frees memory.

## Recovery, 2026-10-11: an agent destroyed work/

Restored from the user's Downloads and the 2026-10-07 backup (details in
docs/decisions.md, 2026-10-11). Never symlink `work` into a worktree; stage files by name.
